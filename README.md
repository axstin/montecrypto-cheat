# montecrypto-cheat
A cheat for [Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma](https://montecrypto-game.github.io/) created from scratch including some useful commands and a UE4 blueprint disassembler

## About

This release is meant to be used for educational purposes only. It can't be compiled without modifications to the source as I have omitted my private memory library (`memutil.h` and `memutil.cpp`). Furthermore, I'm not responsible for anything anyone does with this release (such as applying this cheat and its disassembler to other UE4 games).

For information on how the Bitcoin Enigma was solved and where this tool contributed, see [this blog post.](https://buer.haus/2018/04/24/montecrypto-argss-write-up/)
